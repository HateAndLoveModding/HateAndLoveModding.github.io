	  <p>For you final project in my Computer Science 200 class at the Colorado School of Mines I wanted to make a program that solves a Rubik's cube the same way a human does. I wanted the program to solve it the way a human would instead of using depth or breadth first search because I ultimately wanted to try to make an interactive program that teaches someone how to solve a Rubik's cube. I have not been able to implement that yet but I would like to.</p>
	  <p>In terms of code, the program is actually very simple. It uses a bunch of if statements to determine what moves it should perform, and then performs them. The code uses Object Oriented Programming to attempt to make the code slightly more readable even though you may have not idea what a specific if statement is doing. The cube state is stored in six different arrays, one for each side. There are functions that perform array manipulation to reflect all the different turns of the cube.
