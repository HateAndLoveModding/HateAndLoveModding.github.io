    <h1>Super Epic Bio!</h1>
    <p>My name is Ryker Phelps and I am a passionate software developer and computer science student who loves exploring the endless possibilities of technology. My journey in coding began when one night I decided to learn Python. I taught myself by watching YouTube videos and practicing creating my own projects. One project that I created pretty early on was a Python password manager. I wanted it to be secure using strong encryption and a secure login method. I was hoping to actually use it, but it was not quite practical enough for me even though I implemented things like a qrcode generator to transfer passwords to my phone. I then created some games like Qwixx and Yahtzee in Python. When I got my first iPhone, I enjoyed using Shortcuts to create various automations many of which I still use to this day. My passion has since grown into building powerful tools with Python or C++ and diving deep into areas like systems programming, security, and AI. I am excited to learn new things and am really enjoying my Computer Organization class where we get to learn the assembly language.</p>
    <h1>My Approach to Software Development</h1>
    <p>I'm driven by curiosity and a love for learning. Whether I'm optimizing algorithms, experimenting with new frameworks, or studying low-level programming concepts, I thrive on solving problems and pushing my skills further. One area I'm especially passionate about is writing secure, reliable code. I believe that avoiding common security mistakes and prioritizing best practices is essential to building trustworthy software.</p>
    <h1>Exploring AI and Creativity</h1>
    <p>Beyond traditional coding, I enjoy exploring the creative side of technology. Recently, I have been experimenting with AI-generated music, specifically transforming the Psalms into unique, machine-generated compositions. This intersection of faith, art, and computer science inspires me to think about how technology can be used for more than just efficiency—it can also tell stories and spark imagination.</p>
    <h1>Outside of Coding</h1>
    <p>When I am not programming, you will often find me solving puzzles like the megaminx Rubik's cube, which challenges my logical thinking in a different but equally rewarding way. I also enjoy reading, learning how to defend my faith, and reflecting on how to live with purpose. As a Christian, I am passionate about being a good steward of all that God has entrusted to me—including my time, my car, and my health.</p>
    <h1>What Drives Me</h1>
    <p>At the heart of it all, I love creating, learning, and growing. Whether it is developing smarter automations, studying the foundations of computer science, or sharing my perspectives, I aim to approach everything with intentionality and passion.</p></p>
